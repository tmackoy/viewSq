viewSq
===============

viewSq is a utility for calculating, analyzing, and visualizing static structure factors (S(q)) from trajectories produced using molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations.

A tutorial is available [here](https://github.com/tmackoy/viewSq/tree/master/tutorials/spce_water).

Installation
===============
### LINUX ###


1. Add the following line to /usr/local/lib/vmd/scripts/vmd/loadplugins.tcl

vmd_install_extension viewsq      viewsq_tk_cb    "Analysis/viewSq"

2. Copy the folder "viewsq1.0" to /usr/local/lib/vmd/plugins/noarch/tcl

3. Copy the file "Calculate_rdf_stats_py.py" to /usr/local/lib/vmd/scripts/python

Invoke VMD and look for the plug-in under Extensions->Analysis. 

Ensure Python 3.* is the default. If VMD asks for a path to Python, the following may work:  /usr/bin/python3.


### OSX ###

1. Add the following line to /Applications/VMD 1.9.3.app/Contents/vmd/scripts/vmd/loadplugins.tcl

vmd_install_extension viewsq      viewsq_tk_cb    "Analysis/viewSq"

2. Copy the folder "viewsq1.0" to /Applications/VMD 1.9.3.app/Contents/vmd/plugins/noarch/tcl

3. Copy the file "Calculate_rdf_stats_py.py" to /Applications/VMD 1.9.3.app/Contents/vmd/scripts/python

Ensure Python 3.* is the default. 

VMD 1.9.3 may not be compatible with recent MacOS versions: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/macosxcatalina.html


### WINDOWS ###

1. Add the following line to \VMD\scripts\vmd\loadplugins.tcl

vmd_install_extension viewsq      viewsq_tk_cb    "Analysis/viewSq"

2. Copy the folder "viewsq1.0" to \VMD\plugins\noarch\tcl

3. Copy the file "Calculate_rdf_stats_py.py" to \VMD\scripts\python (the folder may need to be created manually)

Invoke VMD and look for the plug-in under Extensions->Analysis. When running viewSq, VMD may require you to specify the location of the Python script from step #3. Ensure Python 3.* is in the Windows path.

Note: 64-bit Linux versions of VMD with viewSq can also be run using Windows Subsystem for Linux (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and an X server.


Usage
===============
Invoke VMD and look for the viewSq module under Extensions->Analysis.
